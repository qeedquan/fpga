*** JTAG/Serial port
https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers
Windows need to install the VCP drivers to access the serial port and JTAG

Linux automatically recognizes for serial port, but for JTAG need to install drivers provided by the Vivado suite, run 
$XILINX_SDK/Vivado/$VERSION/data/xicom/cable_drivers/lin64/install_script/install_drivers/install_drivers
to install the drivers

*** Serial port mappings
UART0 -> /dev/ttyUSB1
UART1 -> /dev/ttyUSB2

To view serial port output:
screen <serial_port_device> <baudrate>

*** Vitis Platform Domains
Platform domains define where the software will be run on (which CPU core or at what stage), it is a way to organize
projects to be able to make the almagated BOOT.BIN and import the necessary drivers/libraries needed to support the application.

Sample of Available domains:
FSBL:
	The first stage boot loader code

PMUFW:
	The Platform Management Firmware code

Standalone:
	Standalone code to run bare metal, this imports the Drivers/BSP code based on the XSA file generated by Vivado,
	so need to resync every time the Vivado design changes (need to export XSA file and update the platform to use it)

Linux:
	Application will be ran on Linux

*** Copy raw SD image to SD card
Raw SD images are generated through the Vitis embedded platform build, it does not come with BOOT.BIN so after copying
the raw SD image over, we need to copy the BOOT.BIN separately.

dd status=progress bs=4M if=sd_card.img of=/dev/sdc

root.ext4 are raw partition files, we just copy them using dd

dd status=progress bs=4M if=root.ext4 of=/dev/sdc2

*** Filesystem format
First partition stores bootloaders and kernel images, second is the rootfs

mkfs.vfat -F 32 -n boot /dev/sdc1
mkfs.ext4 -L root /dev/sdc2

*** Program the Flash
Need to be in JTAG mode and board booted

Run the hw_server then the SDK contains the program_flash utility

QSPI
program_flash -f BOOT.BIN -fsbl zynqmp_fsbl.elf -offset 0 -flash_type qspi-x4-single -blank_check -verify -cable type xilinx_tcf url TCP:127.0.0.1:3121

eMMC
program_flash -f BOOT.BIN -fsbl zynqmp_fsbl.elf -flash_type emmc -emmc_partition_size large -blank_check -verify -target_id 3 -url TCP:127.0.0.1:3121

*** List all the targets for program_flash
program_flash -jtagtargets -url TCP:127.0.0.1:3121

*** Boot modes

Read this right to left for SW6

0000 - JTAG
0010 - QSPI
1110 - SD 

*** Memory locations

psu_ocm_ram: not usable without setup so it will hang the board
psu_ddr: setup for us to use, should be default location
axi_bram: need to add the AXI BRAM IP to Vivado design to use it
