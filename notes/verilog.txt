including modules:
	It is not mandatory to include all of the source files (.v) in the project,
	various programs will compile it by going out and look up the files in the
	workspace directory as it compiles..
	However, this will kind of act like C by making it very lenient on what it accepts.
	Generally the compilation output will give you what you want in terms of behavior, 
	but it is not valid code.

	An example:
	top.v
	module top(output reg v);
		test t(v);
	endmodule
	
	t.v 
	module t(output reg v);

	This will compile if one doesn't include t.v in the project but will fail
	if one does.

reset signal:
	If the construct is looking for negative edge for reset switch or something
	the first statement must always be a conditional or else it won't even
	compile.
	always @ (posedge clk or negedge rst) begin
		if (!rst) begin
			...
		end
		else begin
			...
		end
	end
